    <p>Lasagna is the name of one of the oldest and best-known pasta shapes.
        It is usually rectangular or ribbon shaped, thicker than tagliatelle, 
        made from a dough based on flour and eggs, with numerous local variants. 
        After being boiled, the rectangular lasagna noodles are drained and placed
         in layers with a filling that varies based on different local traditions.</p>
